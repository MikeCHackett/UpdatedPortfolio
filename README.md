# Updated 2023 portfolio

This is my portfolio website I created using React, Vite and Tailwind CSS. I Applied mobile responsiveness.

## Description

The purpose of this project was to display my skills and projects using React and Tailwind.
I also wanted to test my mobile responsive skills.
This was a great way to test my styling of gradient texts.
